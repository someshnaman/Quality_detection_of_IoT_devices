# Quality detection of IOT Devices
>### **Problem Statement**
Before getting into the Problem Let's try to understand **what are wafer's**?

Wafer (In electronics), also called a slice or substrate, is a thin slice of semiconductor,
such as a crystalline silicon (c-Si), used for fabricationof integrated circuits and in photovoltaics,
to manufacture solar cells.
They are usually placed in remote locations and monitoring all these wayfer sensors is a tough and cost-consuming task so the task was to build a solution that can monitor wafer sensors day in and day out if any alarming situation comes into the picture then one can go replace that wayfer.
